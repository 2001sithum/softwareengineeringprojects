            <h2>Section 3: Extreme Programming (XP)</h2>
            <ol class="question-list">
                <li><p><strong>28.</strong> What is Extreme Programming (XP)?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('ans28')">Show Answer</button><div id="ans28" class="answer">Perhaps the best-known and most widely used Agile method that takes certain good practices of software development to 'extreme' levels.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>29.</strong> Give two examples of what makes XP 'extreme'.</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('ans29')">Show Answer</button><div id="ans29" class="answer">1. New versions may be built several times per day (extreme integration). 2. Increments are delivered to customers every 2 weeks (extreme small releases). 3. Full-time engagement of the customer (extreme customer involvement).</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>30.</strong> What is 'Incremental Planning' in XP?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('ans30')">Show Answer</button><div id="ans30" class="answer">Requirements are recorded on 'Story Cards'. The customer prioritizes stories, and developers break them down into 'Tasks' for planning a release.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>31.</strong> What is the 'Small Releases' principle in XP?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('ans31')">Show Answer</button><div id="ans31" class="answer">The minimal useful set of functionality that provides business value is developed first. Releases are frequent (e.g., every 2 weeks) and incrementally add new functionality.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>32.</strong> What is the 'Simple Design' principle in XP?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('ans32')">Show Answer</button><div id="ans32" class="answer">Only enough design is carried out to meet the *current* requirements and no more. This avoids over-engineering for a future that may not happen.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>33.</strong> What is 'Test-First Development' (TDD)?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('ans33')">Show Answer</button><div id="ans33" class="answer">The practice of writing an automated unit test *before* the functionality is implemented. The code is then written with the goal of making that test pass.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>34.</strong> What is 'Refactoring' in XP?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('ans34')">Show Answer</button><div id="ans34" class="answer">The continuous process of improving the internal structure of the code without changing its external behavior. This keeps the code simple and maintainable.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>35.</strong> What is 'Pair Programming'?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('ans35')">Show Answer</button><div id="ans35" class="answer">Two developers work together at one workstation, with one 'driving' (writing code) and the other 'navigating' (reviewing and thinking strategically). It acts as a continuous code review.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>36.</strong> What is 'Collective Ownership'?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('ans36')">Show Answer</button><div id="ans36" class="answer">The principle that anyone on the team can change any part of the system's code. This prevents knowledge silos and encourages shared responsibility.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>37.</strong> What is 'Continuous Integration'?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('ans37')">Show Answer</button><div id="ans37" class="answer">As soon as a task is complete, the code is integrated into the whole system. After integration, all unit tests in the system must pass.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>38.</strong> What is 'Sustainable Pace'?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('ans38')">Show Answer</button><div id="ans38" class="answer">The practice of avoiding overtime, as it leads to burnout and reduced code quality. The team should work at a pace that can be sustained long-term.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>39.</strong> What is the 'On-Site Customer'?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('ans39')">Show Answer</button><div id="ans39" class="answer">A representative of the end-user who is available full-time to the XP team to answer questions, write stories, and provide immediate feedback.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>40.</strong> What is a 'user story' in XP?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('ans40')">Show Answer</button><div id="ans40" class="answer">A short, high-level description of a requirement written from the perspective of the user. They are written on cards and used for planning.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>41.</strong> How does XP handle changes, as opposed to conventional wisdom?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('ans41')">Show Answer</button><div id="ans41" class="answer">Conventional wisdom is to design for anticipated future changes. XP maintains this is not worthwhile as changes cannot be reliably anticipated. Instead, it proposes constant refactoring to make the code easy to change when the need arises.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>42.</strong> What is the main benefit of Test-First Development?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('ans42')">Show Answer</button><div id="ans42" class="answer">Writing tests before code clarifies the requirements to be implemented and ensures that all new functionality is covered by automated tests, preventing regression errors.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>43.</strong> How does Pair Programming spread knowledge across the team?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('ans43')">Show Answer</button><div id="ans43" class="answer">As pairs rotate and work on different parts of the system, every developer gains familiarity with the entire codebase, which supports collective code ownership.</div></li>
