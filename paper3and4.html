              Theoretical Deep Dive: The Philosophy of Change in Agile
            </h4>
            <p>
              Traditional software development models, like the Waterfall model,
              treat change as an error—something to be avoided and controlled
              through rigid change management processes. Agile methodologies
              were born from the realization that for most modern software,
              change is inevitable and should be embraced.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <strong>Agile Manifesto (2001)</strong> explicitly values
              <strong>"Responding to change over following a plan."</strong>
              This is a fundamental philosophical shift. Agile builds processes
              designed to harness change for the customer's competitive
              advantage through empiricism, time-boxing, and dedicated roles
              like the Product Owner.

            <p>
              Agile methods are fundamentally designed to accommodate changing
              requirements. They achieve this through several core practices:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Iterative and Incremental Development:</strong> Projects
                are broken into short sprints (1-4 weeks), each delivering a
                working piece of software. This provides frequent opportunities
                to review progress and adapt the plan for the next sprint based
                on new or changed requirements.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Dynamic Product Backlog:</strong> All requirements are
                held in a prioritized product backlog. This is a living document
                that the Product Owner can re-prioritize at any time to reflect
                changing business needs, ensuring the team is always working on
                the most valuable items next.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Continuous Customer Collaboration:</strong> Agile
                insists on close, daily collaboration between developers and
                business stakeholders. This constant communication ensures the
                team has a current understanding of requirements. The sprint
                review meeting provides a formal feedback loop where
                stakeholders can see the working software and guide future
                development.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Short Feedback Loops:</strong> Practices like daily
                stand-ups and end-of-sprint retrospectives create extremely
                short feedback cycles, allowing the team to identify
                misunderstandings and adapt to changes almost immediately.

            <p>
              Cowboy coding, an unstructured and ad-hoc approach, is suitable
              for problems that are both
              <strong>small and well-understood</strong> for two main reasons:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Minimal Cognitive Load:</strong> For a small problem, a
                single developer can manage the entire scope in their head
                without needing formal design documents or requirement
                specifications. Because the problem is "well-understood," the
                requirements are clear and stable, eliminating the need for
                processes that manage change.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Maximum Speed through Zero Process Overhead:</strong> By
                skipping all formal processes (planning, design, documentation,
                formal testing), the developer can move from problem to solution
                at maximum speed. This is acceptable for one-off tasks,
                disposable prototypes, or personal scripts where long-term
                maintainability and collaboration are not concerns, as the cost
                of process outweighs its benefits.

            <p>
              Continuous refactoring is vital for maintaining a healthy codebase
              in Agile, but it presents several challenges:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Justifying Time Investment:</strong> Refactoring is
                "invisible" work that doesn't add new features. In high-pressure
                projects, teams face pressure to skip refactoring in favor of
                delivering visible functionality, leading to the accumulation of
                technical debt.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Risk of Introducing Defects:</strong> Refactoring
                without a comprehensive suite of automated tests is extremely
                risky. A developer can inadvertently change the software's
                behavior, introducing subtle regression bugs. A strong testing
                culture is therefore a prerequisite.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Dependency on Developer Skill:</strong> Effective
                refactoring requires experience. Junior developers may not know
                when or how to refactor properly and can potentially make the
                code quality worse. It also requires consistent discipline from
                the entire team.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Difficulty with Large-Scale Refactoring:</strong> While
                Agile is suited for small, continuous improvements, major
                architectural refactoring can be difficult to fit into short
                sprints and can be highly disruptive to the team's delivery
                velocity.

            <p>
              In a project with frequently changing requirements, Test-Driven
              Development (TDD) faces several challenges:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Test Churn and Rework:</strong> In TDD, tests act as the
                specification. When requirements change, the tests defining them
                become obsolete. Developers must spend significant time
                rewriting or deleting tests before they can change the
                production code, which can feel like wasted effort and slow down
                response time.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Difficulty Testing Unclear Requirements:</strong> TDD
                requires a clear enough understanding of a feature to write a
                failing test first. If requirements are volatile or vague, it's
                difficult to write a meaningful test, leading to tests that are
                either wrong or need to be discarded.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Ineffectiveness for Architectural Changes:</strong> TDD
                excels at guiding low-level class design. It is less effective
                for guiding high-level architecture. If a requirement change
                forces a major architectural shift, a large number of unit tests
                may become irrelevant and must be thrown away.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>High Maintenance Overhead:</strong> Constant requirement
                changes can lead to a "brittle" test suite, where tests break
                easily with small implementation changes. This increases the
                maintenance burden, as developers spend more time fixing tests
                than delivering new value.

              Preparing inspection checklists is crucial for effective software

            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Ensures a Systematic Process:</strong> A checklist
                transforms the inspection from an ad-hoc review into a formal,
                repeatable process, ensuring all inspectors are consistently
                looking for the same types of issues.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Provides Focus and Guidance:</strong> It directs the
                inspectors' attention to known problem areas and common types of
                errors (e.g., null pointer exceptions, security
                vulnerabilities), which is especially helpful for less
                experienced reviewers and increases defect detection rates.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Guarantees Comprehensive Coverage:</strong> A checklist
                acts as a cognitive aid to ensure that important checks (e.g.,
                for error handling, resource management, standards compliance)
                are not forgotten or overlooked during the inspection.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Captures Organizational Knowledge:</strong> Checklists
                can be updated over time based on defects found in past
                projects, turning them into a living repository of
                organizational knowledge that helps prevent common errors from
                recurring.

              Software inspections are particularly appropriate for lower-level,
              weakly typed languages (like C) because the inspection process
              compensates for the limited error-checking capabilities of their
              compilers.

            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Compensating for Compiler Weaknesses:</strong> Compilers
                for strongly typed languages (like Java) catch many
                type-mismatch and memory-safety errors. In contrast, C compilers
                are more permissive, allowing unsafe operations like buffer
                overflows or invalid pointer casts. Inspections provide the
                necessary manual check to find these defects that the compiler
                misses.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Detecting Language-Specific Errors:</strong> Lower-level
                languages give developers direct control over memory, a common
                source of critical bugs. Inspections are highly effective at
                finding errors that are hard to reproduce with testing, such as
                memory leaks, dangling pointers, and uninitialized variables. An
                experienced inspector can spot the patterns that lead to these
                subtle but severe bugs.

            <p>The provided Python function has several code quality issues:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Poor Naming:</strong> The names `func_2`, `a`, `b`, and
                `c` are meaningless and non-descriptive. They make the code hard
                to understand without analyzing its logic. Better names would be
                `is_admin` for the function and `username` for the parameter
                `a`.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Unnecessary Variables:</strong> The variable `c` is
                assigned but never used, making it dead code that adds clutter.
                The variable `b` is also redundant; it's used as a flag when the
                result of the comparison can be returned directly.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Verbose Logic:</strong> The pattern of initializing a
                boolean, changing it in an `if` block, and then returning it is
                unnecessarily complex. The entire function can be simplified to
                a single line.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Lack of Type Hints and Docstrings:</strong> The function
                lacks professional conventions like type hints (e.g., `def
                is_admin(username: str) -> bool:`) and a docstring to explain
                its purpose, parameters, and return value.

              A program in a real-world environment must change or become less
              useful due to the principle of
              <strong>software evolution</strong>, as described by Lehman's
              Laws. The core reason is that software is a model of a dynamic
              real-world environment, and it must adapt to remain aligned with
              that environment.

                If the software does not adapt to these changes (e.g., updating
                an accounting system for a new tax law), it no longer accurately
                models its environment and loses its value.

                <strong>Unbounded Object Creation:</strong> The `create_item`
                function has an infinite `while True` loop that continuously
                creates new instances of the `ItemSet` class.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Continuous Memory Allocation:</strong> Each `ItemSet`
                object allocates a large amount of memory (a list of one million
                integers). This memory is allocated on the heap.

              <li>
                <strong>Garbage Collector Ineffectiveness:</strong> Each created

              The selection of a programming language is a significant decision
              that directly and indirectly depends on cost in several ways:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Development and Maintenance Costs:</strong> Languages
                that promote readability, have strong typing, and offer modern
                features can reduce development time and the number of bugs,
                lowering initial costs. More importantly, a clean, maintainable
                language (like Python or C#) significantly reduces long-term
                maintenance costs, which often constitute the largest portion of
                a software's total cost of ownership.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Developer Salaries and Availability:</strong> The cost
                of hiring developers varies significantly by language. There is
                a large and relatively affordable talent pool for popular
                languages like JavaScript and Python. Niche or older languages
                (like COBOL or Lisp) command higher salaries due to the scarcity
                of experts, increasing project labor costs.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Licensing and Tooling Costs:</strong> Some programming
                languages or their associated development environments and
                libraries require expensive commercial licenses (e.g., certain
                Microsoft or Oracle platforms). In contrast, open-source
                languages (like Python, Java, Rust) and their ecosystems are
                free, drastically reducing upfront tooling costs.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Performance and Infrastructure Costs:</strong> The
                performance characteristics of a language impact hardware
                requirements. A highly performant, compiled language (like C++
                or Go) might require fewer servers to handle a given workload
                compared to a slower, interpreted language, thus lowering
                long-term infrastructure and hosting costs.

              The emergency repair process (often called a "hotfix") differs
              from the standard change implementation process primarily in its
              **urgency, scope, and process rigor**.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Urgency and Scope:</strong> An emergency repair is a
                reactive process triggered by a critical production failure
                (e.g., a system crash or major security vulnerability) that
                demands an immediate fix. Its scope is narrowly focused on
                resolving only that specific critical issue as quickly as
                possible. A standard change, in contrast, is typically a
                planned, proactive process for adding new features or making
                non-critical improvements, following a regular release schedule.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Process Rigor:</strong> To achieve speed, the emergency
                process deliberately bypasses or shortens several stages of the
                standard process. Standard changes go through detailed analysis,
                design, full regression testing, and quality assurance. An
                emergency repair may involve a quick diagnosis, a minimal code
                change, and only essential testing focused on the fix and its
                immediate impact, deferring full regression testing until later.
                The goal is to restore service first and ensure full quality
                compliance second.

              Re-engineering (improving an existing system) is considered less
              risky than forward engineering (building a new system from
              scratch) for several key reasons:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Reduced Requirements Risk:</strong> The greatest risk in
                software development is building the wrong system. With
                re-engineering, the existing system serves as a working,
                validated specification. The core business logic and
                requirements are already known, tested, and understood from
                years of operational use. Forward engineering, in contrast,
                starts with abstract requirements that are often incomplete,
                ambiguous, or incorrect, carrying a high risk of
                misinterpretation and project failure.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Incremental and Reversible Process:</strong>
                Re-engineering can be performed incrementally. Parts of the
                system can be improved and deployed one at a time, allowing for
                a gradual, controlled migration. This reduces the "big bang"
                risk of a single, massive deployment failure. If a re-engineered
                component fails, it's often possible to revert to the old
                version. Forward engineering is typically an all-or-nothing
                proposition with a high-stakes cutover.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Preservation of Embedded Business Knowledge:</strong>
                Legacy systems often contain years of accumulated, subtle, and
                often undocumented business rules within their code. Forward
                engineering risks losing this invaluable knowledge.
                Re-engineering is a process of extracting, understanding, and
                preserving this logic while improving the underlying technical
                structure, thus reducing the risk of functional regressions.

            <p>
              Stress testing is critically important for e-commerce systems
              because their revenue and reputation are directly tied to their
              performance and availability, especially during periods of high
              traffic. The importance can be explained by four key factors:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Handling Peak Traffic Loads:</strong> E-commerce sites
                experience massive, predictable traffic spikes during events
                like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, or promotional sales. Stress
                testing simulates these extreme conditions to ensure the system
                (including servers, databases, and payment gateways) can handle
                the load without crashing or becoming unresponsive. System
                failure during a peak event results in immediate and significant
                revenue loss.

                  >Ensuring Positive User Experience and Conversion:</strong
                >
                Under heavy load, system response times can degrade. Slow page
                loads, lagging checkouts, and unresponsive buttons lead to user
                frustration. Studies show that even a one-second delay in page
                load time can drastically reduce conversion rates. Stress
                testing helps identify and eliminate performance bottlenecks,
                ensuring the site remains fast and responsive, which is
                essential for converting visitors into paying customers.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Maintaining Transactional Integrity:</strong> An
                e-commerce transaction involves multiple steps (inventory check,
                payment processing, order confirmation). Under stress, race
                conditions or database deadlocks can occur, potentially leading
                to lost orders, incorrect inventory counts, or double-billing.
                Stress testing helps uncover these concurrency issues, ensuring
                that every transaction is processed reliably and correctly even
                when thousands are happening simultaneously.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Protecting Brand Reputation:</strong> A website that
                crashes during a major sale not only loses immediate revenue but
                also suffers long-term damage to its brand reputation. Customers
                lose trust in an unreliable site and may choose competitors for
                future purchases. Stress testing is a proactive measure to
                protect against this reputational damage by ensuring the system
                is robust and dependable.

              The verification and validation (V&V) process must establish
              confidence that software is "fit for purpose" because perfection
              in non-trivial software is economically and practically
              unattainable. The goal of V&V is not to prove that the software is
              100% free of defects, but to ensure it meets a sufficient level of
              quality for its intended operational context. This is important
              for several reasons:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Risk Management:</strong> The level of confidence
                required is directly proportional to the risk associated with
                software failure. For a safety-critical system like an
                aircraft's flight control software, the purpose demands an
                extremely high level of confidence, requiring rigorous V&V to
                ensure there are no catastrophic failures. For a simple
                marketing website, the purpose can tolerate minor cosmetic bugs,
                so the V&V effort can be less intensive. V&V is used to reduce
                the risk of failure to an acceptable level for the system's
                specific purpose.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Economic Feasibility:</strong> The cost of finding and
                fixing every single bug in a complex system can be astronomical
                and may delay delivery indefinitely. The "fit for purpose"
                principle allows for a pragmatic balance between quality, cost,
                and schedule. V&V activities are planned to provide the
                necessary confidence for the intended use, without
                over-investing in finding and fixing low-impact defects that do
                not hinder the software's primary function.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>User and Stakeholder Acceptance:</strong> Ultimately,
                software is successful if its users and stakeholders trust it to
                do its job. The V&V process, through activities like testing and
                inspections, generates evidence (e.g., test reports, review
                logs) that demonstrates the software meets its specified
                requirements (verification) and fulfills the users' actual needs
                (validation). This evidence builds the necessary confidence for
                stakeholders to accept and deploy the system.

                <strong>Reduced Infrastructure and Overhead Costs:</strong> This
                is the most direct advantage. Traditional companies incur
                massive expenses for commercial office space, utilities
                (electricity, internet), office furniture, and maintenance. By
                operating virtually, these costs are almost entirely eliminated.
                This dramatically lowers the company's overhead, which is a

                significantly lower average salary cost, directly reducing the
                largest cost component of most software projects: developer
                salaries.

                <strong>Elimination of Travel and Commuting Costs:</strong>
                Project costs in traditional companies often include travel
                expenses for on-site meetings with clients or between
                distributed teams. Virtual companies eliminate these costs by
                relying on digital communication tools. Additionally, employees
                save time and money on commuting, which can be a factor in
                accepting a lower salary, further reducing labor costs.

            Explain the necessity of using tools such as a Configuration

              A Configuration Management Database (CMDB) is a centralized
              repository that stores information about all the significant
              components, known as Configuration Items (CIs), in an IT
              environment. Using a CMDB is necessary for modern IT operations
              and software management for the following reasons:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Centralized Information and Visibility:</strong> In a
                complex IT landscape, a CMDB provides a single, trusted source
                of truth. It maps out all CIs—such as servers, applications,
                databases, and network devices—and, crucially, shows the
                relationships and dependencies between them. This visibility is
                essential for understanding how a change to one component (e.g.,
                patching a server) might impact other dependent services.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Impact Analysis and Change Management:</strong> The
                primary necessity of a CMDB is to enable effective change
                management. Before deploying a software update or making an
                infrastructure change, teams can query the CMDB to perform an
                impact analysis. This helps to identify all potentially affected
                systems and services, allowing for better planning, risk
                assessment, and communication, thereby reducing the likelihood
                of causing an unexpected outage.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Faster Incident and Problem Resolution:</strong> When an
                incident occurs (e.g., a software service is down), a CMDB is
                invaluable for troubleshooting. Support teams can quickly look
                up the failing service to see its dependencies (e.g., which
                database it connects to, which server it runs on) and its recent
                change history. This context dramatically speeds up root cause
                analysis and reduces the Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR).

          <h3>Question 5(e)</h3>
          <p class="question-prompt">
            Describe how user interfaces (UIs) impact a software system. (04
            marks)
          </p>

            <p>
              The user interface (UI) is the bridge between the user and the
              system's functionality. Its impact on a software system is
              profound and multifaceted, extending far beyond simple aesthetics.
              The key impacts are:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Usability and User Adoption:</strong> The UI is the
                primary determinant of a system's usability. A clean, intuitive,
                and efficient UI allows users to accomplish their tasks with
                minimal effort and training, leading to high user satisfaction
                and successful adoption. Conversely, a confusing or clunky UI,
                regardless of how powerful the underlying system is, will lead
                to user frustration, errors, low productivity, and ultimately,
                system abandonment.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Perceived Quality and Trust:</strong> Users often judge
                the overall quality and reliability of a system based on its UI.
                A professional, responsive, and error-free interface instills a
                sense of trust and confidence in the user. A poorly designed UI
                with inconsistent layouts, typos, or slow responses can make the
                entire system feel unprofessional and untrustworthy, even if its
                core logic is sound.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Efficiency and Task Completion Rate:</strong> A
                well-designed UI directly impacts user efficiency. By optimizing
                workflows, providing clear navigation, and minimizing the number
                of steps required to complete a task, a good UI can save users
                significant amounts of time. This increases productivity in a
                business context and improves conversion rates in a commercial
                context (e.g., e-commerce checkout).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Reduction in Support and Training Costs:</strong> An
                intuitive UI is self-explanatory. This drastically reduces the
                need for extensive user training manuals and lowers the burden
                on customer support channels. When users can easily figure out
                how to use the system on their own, the organization saves
                significant costs associated with training and resolving support
                tickets.
