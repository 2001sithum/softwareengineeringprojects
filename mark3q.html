      <li><p class="question-text">What is the difference between Production Timing for Goods vs. Services?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show</button><div class="answer"><p>Goods are typically produced before they are consumed. Services are usually produced and consumed simultaneously (e.g., a haircut).</p></div></li>
      <li><p class="question-text">Why is Quality Control generally harder for services than for goods?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show</button><div class="answer"><p>Because services are often delivered by people, their quality can vary depending on the provider, the customer, and the situation. It is harder to standardize a service than a mass-produced physical good.</p></div></li>

      <li><p class="question-text">Is the "Marketing is ?" slide an effective way to begin defining a concept? Why or why not?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show</button><div class="answer"><p>Yes, it can be effective.
