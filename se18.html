            <ol class="question-list">
                <li><p><strong>61.</strong> What is the 'Legacy Challenge'?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('ans61')">Show Answer</button><div id="ans61" class="answer">The challenge of maintaining and evolving old, valuable systems that were developed long ago using outdated technologies, which are often critical to business operations.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>62.</strong> What is the 'Heterogeneity Challenge'?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('ans62')">Show Answer</button><div id="ans62" class="answer">The challenge of developing and maintaining systems that are distributed across networks and must operate on a diverse range of hardware platforms and operating systems.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>63.</strong> What is the 'Delivery Challenge'?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('ans63')">Show Answer</button><div id="ans63" class="answer">The challenge of delivering systems quickly enough to meet the rapidly changing demands of the business and market, without sacrificing quality.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>64.</strong> Why is maintaining legacy systems often difficult?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('ans64')">Show Answer</button><div id="ans64" class="answer">They may lack documentation, use obsolete programming languages, have a degraded structure, and the original developers may no longer be available.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>65.</strong> How do modern architectures like microservices relate to the Heterogeneity Challenge?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('ans65')">Show Answer</button><div id="ans65" class="answer">They embrace heterogeneity by allowing different services within a single application to be built with different technologies, but this also increases the complexity of maintaining the overall distributed system.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>66.</strong> Which type of software process model is best suited to address the Delivery Challenge?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('ans66')">Show Answer</button><div id="ans66" class="answer">Iterative and Agile models are best suited, as they focus on delivering working software in small, frequent increments, allowing for rapid delivery of value.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>67.</strong> Is it always best to replace a legacy system?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('ans67')">Show Answer</button><div id="ans67" class="answer">No. If the legacy system is stable and still provides significant business value, the cost and risk of replacing it may be much higher than the cost of continuing to maintain it.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>68.</strong> How does cloud computing impact the Heterogeneity Challenge?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('ans68')">Show Answer</button><div id="ans68" class="answer">It can both simplify and complicate it. It simplifies by abstracting away hardware differences, but complicates it by introducing complex distributed network environments.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>69.</strong> What is the main trade-off in the Delivery Challenge?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('ans69')">Show Answer</button><div id="ans69" class="answer">The primary trade-off is between speed of delivery, cost, and the quality/reliability of the software. Moving faster often increases cost or reduces quality.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>70.</strong> How are these three challenges interconnected?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('ans70')">Show Answer</button><div id="ans70" class="answer">A legacy system (Legacy Challenge) that needs to connect to modern services (Heterogeneity Challenge) often needs changes delivered quickly to stay competitive (Delivery Challenge). Addressing one often impacts the others.</div></li>
