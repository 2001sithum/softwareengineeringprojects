                <li><p><strong>50.</strong> Why is static analysis particularly valuable for languages like C?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('ans50')">Show Answer</button><div id="ans50" class="answer">Because C has weak type checking, so many common errors (like type mismatches) are not detected by the compiler.
