            <li><p class="question-text">Define "Pricing" as a process.</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show</button><div class="answer"><p>Pricing is the process of determining the monetary value of a product or service.</p></div></li>
            <li><p class="question-text">List the three key points on the "Importance of Pricing."</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show</button><div class="answer"><p>1. It influences customer purchasing decisions. 2. It impacts business profitability. 3. It reflects brand positioning and value proposition.</p></div></li>
            <li><p class="question-text">What is the Economist's view of price?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show</button><div class="answer"><p>Price is set by the forces of supply and demand.</p></div></li>
            <li><p class="question-text">What is the Accountant's view of price?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show</button><div class="answer"><p>Price should cover costs so that a profit can be made.</p></div></li>
            <li><p class="question-text">What is the Customer's view of price?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show</button><div class="answer"><p>Price has to represent good value.</p></div></li>
            <li><p class="question-text">What is the Marketer's view of price?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show</button><div class="answer"><p>Pricing is an opportunity to gain a competitive advantage.</p></div></li>
            <li><p class="question-text">Provide four different "names" for price as shown in the presentation.</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show</button><div class="answer"><p>Examples include: Tuition (for education), Rent (for property), Fare (for transport), Dues (for membership), Premium (for insurance), Fee (for professional services), Salary/Wage (for labor).</p></div></li>
            <li><p class="question-text">What are the three "Internal Factors" to consider in pricing?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show</button><div class="answer"><p>1.

            <li><p class="question-text">How do marketing objectives (e.g., maximizing market share) influence pricing?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show</button><div class="answer"><p>The objective dictates the strategy. An objective to maximize market share would likely lead to a lower price (penetration pricing), while an objective to maximize profit might lead to a higher price (skimming pricing).</p></div></li>
            <li><p class="question-text">Explain how "other elements of the marketing mix" can be an internal factor in pricing.</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show</button><div class="answer"><p>The price must be consistent with the other 3Ps. A high-quality product (Product) sold in luxury stores (Place) with premium advertising (Promotion) requires a high price to maintain a consistent brand image.</p></div></li>
            <li><p class="question-text">How does the "nature of the market" (e.g., monopoly vs. perfect competition) affect pricing freedom?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show</button><div class="answer"><p>In a monopoly, a firm has significant pricing freedom. In a perfectly competitive market, the firm has very little freedom and is often a "price taker," having to accept the prevailing market price.</p></div></li>
            <li><p class="question-text">What is "price elasticity of demand"?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show</button><div class="answer"><p>It is a measure of how sensitive the quantity demanded of a good is to a change in its price. If demand changes a lot with a small price change, it is elastic. If demand changes little with a price change, it is inelastic.</p></div></li>
            <li><p class="question-text">How does a competitor's strategy influence a company's pricing?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show</button><div class="answer"><p>A company must be aware of its competitors' prices and position. It may choose to price at, above, or below the competition, but the competitor's price serves as a critical reference point.</p></div></li>
