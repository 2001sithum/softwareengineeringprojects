              Theoretical Deep Dive: The Philosophy of Change in Agile
            </h4>
            <p>
              Traditional software development models, like the Waterfall model,
              treat change as an error—something to be avoided and controlled
              through rigid change management processes. These models operate on
              the assumption that requirements can be fully understood and
              frozen upfront. Decades of software projects proved this
              assumption to be flawed, especially for complex, innovative
              systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              Agile methodologies were born from this realization. The
              <strong>Agile Manifesto (2001)</strong> explicitly values
              <strong>"Responding to change over following a plan."</strong>
              This is not just a preference; it is a fundamental philosophical
              shift. Agile does not just tolerate change; it assumes change is
              inevitable and beneficial. It builds processes designed to harness
              change for the customer's competitive advantage.
            </p>
            <h4>Key Mechanisms for Accommodating Change:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Empiricism:</strong> Agile is based on the empirical
                process control theory, which asserts that knowledge comes from
                experience and making decisions based on what is known. The
                short cycles (sprints) are experiments that allow the team to
                learn and adapt based on real evidence (working software) rather
                than speculation.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Time-boxing:</strong> By fixing the length of an
                iteration (e.g., two weeks), the scope becomes the variable.
                This allows the team to deliver value predictably while giving
                the product owner the flexibility to change the scope for the
                next time-box.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>The Role of the Product Owner:</strong> In frameworks
                like Scrum, the Product Owner is the single point of contact for
                all requirements. Their primary job is to maximize the value of
                the product resulting from the work of the Development Team. A
                key part of this is continuously ordering and re-ordering the
                Product Backlog to reflect changing priorities, market
                conditions, and stakeholder feedback.
              </li>

            <p>
              Agile methods are fundamentally designed to accommodate and even
              welcome changing requirements, viewing them as a source of
              competitive advantage for the customer. They achieve this through
              several core practices and principles:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Iterative and Incremental Development:</strong> Agile
                projects are broken down into short, time-boxed iterations (or
                sprints), typically lasting 1-4 weeks. At the end of each
                iteration, the team delivers a potentially shippable increment
                of the product. This iterative cycle provides regular and
                frequent opportunities to review progress and adapt the plan.
                Requirements for the next iteration are selected just before it
                begins, allowing new or changed requirements to be incorporated
                quickly.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Dynamic Product Backlog:</strong> All requirements are
                maintained in a prioritized list called the product backlog.
                This is not a static document; it is a living artifact that is
                continuously refined and re-prioritized by the product owner. If
                business needs change, the product owner can add, remove, or
                change the priority of items in the backlog to reflect the new
                reality. The team then pulls the highest-priority items for the
                next iteration.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Continuous Customer Collaboration:</strong> Agile
                methodologies insist on close, daily collaboration between
                developers and business stakeholders (like the product owner).
                This constant communication ensures that the development team
                has a clear and current understanding of the requirements. The
                sprint review meeting at the end of each iteration is a formal
                opportunity for stakeholders to see the working software and
                provide direct feedback, which can then guide changes for
                subsequent iterations.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Short Feedback Loops:</strong> Agile practices like
                daily stand-up meetings, sprint reviews, and retrospectives
                create extremely short feedback cycles. This allows the team to
                identify misunderstandings or necessary changes almost
                immediately, rather than waiting for a formal change request
                process as seen in traditional waterfall models. This
                flexibility allows the project to pivot quickly in response to
                market or business changes.

              Theoretical Deep Dive: Process Models and Overhead
            </h4>
            <p>
              Every software development process, from Waterfall to Scrum,
              introduces a certain amount of "process overhead." This overhead
              includes time spent on activities that are not directly writing
              code, such as requirements gathering, design meetings, creating
              documentation, writing tests, and project planning. The purpose of
              this overhead is to manage complexity and reduce risk. The more
              complex, large, and long-lived a project is, the more essential
              this overhead becomes.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Cowboy Coding</strong> is the absolute extreme of
              minimizing this overhead—it reduces it to zero. It operates on the
              principle that for certain problems, the cost of the process is
              greater than the value it provides. This is only true when the
              complexity and risk are negligible.
            </p>
            <h4>When Process Overhead is Unnecessary:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Small Scope:</strong> The entire problem can be held in
                a single person's short-term memory. There is no need for
                external documentation to manage complexity because there is
                very little complexity to manage.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Well-Understood Requirements:</strong> The requirements
                are static and perfectly clear. There is no risk of building the
                wrong thing, so processes designed to gather feedback and manage
                change (like Agile iterations) are redundant.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Single Developer:</strong> There is no team. Therefore,
                processes designed to facilitate communication and collaboration
                (like stand-up meetings, version control, or code reviews)
                provide no value.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Low Consequence of Failure:</strong> The software is not
                mission-critical. If it has bugs or fails, the impact is
                minimal. Therefore, formal quality assurance processes (like
                inspections or rigorous testing) are not required. This is
                typical of personal scripts, academic exercises, or disposable
                prototypes.
              </li>

            <h4 class="box-title">Model Answer</h4>
            <p>
              Cowboy coding refers to an unstructured and ad-hoc software
              development approach where an individual programmer works with
              little to no formal methodology, planning, or documentation. While
              generally considered an anti-pattern in professional software
              engineering, it can be suitable for a very narrow category of
              problems: those that are both
              <strong>small and well-understood</strong>. This suitability
              arises from two main factors:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong
                  >Minimal Cognitive Load and No Need for Formalism:</strong
                >
                For a small problem, a single developer can comprehend and
                manage the entire scope, architecture, and state of the system
                in their mind. There is no need for extensive design documents
                or requirement specifications because the problem is not complex
                enough to warrant them. Similarly, because the problem is
                "well-understood," the requirements are clear and stable,
                eliminating the need for iterative processes to handle change.
                The developer can proceed directly to implementation.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Maximum Speed through Zero Process Overhead:</strong>
                The main advantage of cowboy coding is its speed in this limited
                context. By skipping all formal processes—such as planning
                meetings, design reviews, documentation, and automated
                testing—the developer can focus exclusively on writing code.
                This lack of overhead allows for the fastest possible path from
                a problem statement to a working solution. This is acceptable
                when the project is a one-off task, a disposable prototype, or a
                personal script where long-term maintainability and
                collaboration are not concerns.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              However, it is critical to note that this approach fails
              completely for larger, complex, or long-term projects, as it leads
              to unmaintainable, low-quality software and is incompatible with
              teamwork.

              Theoretical Deep Dive: Technical Debt and Code Smells
            </h4>
            <p>
              The need for refactoring arises from the concept of
              <strong>Technical Debt</strong>, a metaphor coined by Ward
              Cunningham. It describes the implied cost of rework caused by
              choosing an easy (limited) solution now instead of using a better
              approach that would take longer. Like financial debt, if technical
              debt is not repaid, it accumulates "interest," making it harder
              and harder to implement changes in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Continuous Refactoring</strong> is the practice of
              constantly "repaying" this debt in small increments to keep the
              codebase healthy. The triggers for refactoring are often
              identified as <strong>"Code Smells"</strong> (a term popularized
              by Kent Beck and Martin Fowler). A code smell is a surface
              indication in the code that usually corresponds to a deeper
              problem in the system. Refactoring is the process of removing
              these smells.

              The challenge of continuous refactoring is balancing the immediate
              need to deliver features with the long-term need to maintain a
              clean codebase, all while managing the inherent risks of changing
              working code.

            <p>
              Continuous refactoring is a cornerstone of Agile development,
              enabling teams to maintain a clean, adaptable codebase that can
              evolve with changing requirements. However, implementing this
              principle effectively presents several significant challenges:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong
                  >Justifying Time Investment vs. Feature Delivery:</strong
                >
                Refactoring is internal quality improvement and does not produce
                new, visible features for the customer. In projects with tight
                deadlines, there is often immense pressure from product owners
                or management to prioritize new functionality over this
                "invisible" work. Teams can struggle to allocate sufficient time
                for refactoring, leading to the accumulation of technical debt,
                which ironically slows down future development.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Risk of Introducing Regression Errors:</strong> The core
                rule of refactoring is to change the code's structure without
                altering its external behavior. This is extremely risky without
                a comprehensive and reliable suite of automated tests (unit,
                integration, etc.). If the test coverage is inadequate, a
                developer might inadvertently introduce subtle bugs
                (regressions) while refactoring. The fear of breaking existing
                functionality can cause teams to avoid necessary refactoring.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Dependency on Developer Skill and Discipline:</strong>
                Knowing what to refactor, how to do it safely, and when to stop
                requires experience. Junior developers may struggle to identify
                "code smells" or may apply refactorings incorrectly, potentially
                making the design worse. It also requires a consistent,
                team-wide discipline to continuously clean the code, which can
                be difficult to maintain over the long term.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Difficulty with Large-Scale Refactoring:</strong>
                Agile's short iterations are well-suited for small, incremental
                refactorings. However, sometimes the codebase requires a
                large-scale or architectural refactoring that cannot be
                completed within a single sprint. Planning and executing these
                major changes without disrupting the team's ongoing work and
                delivery commitments is a significant logistical challenge.

              Theoretical Deep Dive: TDD as a Design Tool
            </h4>
            <p>
              A common misconception is that Test-Driven Development (TDD) is
              primarily a testing technique. While it produces a comprehensive
              suite of tests as a by-product, its main purpose is to guide
              <strong>software design</strong>. By forcing the developer to
              first think about a piece of functionality from the perspective of
              a user (or client) of that code, TDD leads to better-designed,
              more decoupled, and more easily testable code.
            </p>
            <p>
              The TDD cycle (Red -> Green -> Refactor) is a micro-process for
              developing software in very small, verifiable steps. The tests act
              as an executable, unambiguous specification for the behavior of
              the code.
            </p>
            <h4>The Challenge of Specification Change:</h4>
            <p>
              The core challenge arises because TDD binds the code so tightly to
              its specification (the tests). When the specification itself is
              volatile, the work invested in creating that tight bond can feel
              wasted.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Coupling of Test and Code:</strong> In TDD, the test and
                the code it drives are highly coupled. A change in requirements
                invalidates both.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>TDD and Emergent Design:</strong> Proponents of TDD
                argue that it helps with changing requirements because the
                refactoring step allows the design to emerge and adapt. However,
                this applies more to the internal implementation details. When
                the external contract or the fundamental purpose of a feature
                changes, the tests that define that contract must be thrown away
                and rewritten.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Behavior-Driven Development (BDD):</strong> BDD is an
                evolution of TDD that attempts to address this challenge by
                focusing tests on business-level "behaviors" rather than
                low-level implementation details. BDD tests are written in a
                more human-readable language (e.g., Gherkin) and are more
                resilient to minor implementation changes, but they still need
                to be rewritten if the core business rule changes.

            <p>
              Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a powerful practice that uses
              automated tests to guide design and ensure code quality. However,
              in projects with highly volatile and frequently changing
              requirements, TDD can present several distinct challenges:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Significant Test Churn and Rework:</strong> In TDD,
                tests serve as a concrete definition of requirements. When a
                requirement changes, the tests that define it become invalid.
                This means the developer must first invest significant time and
                effort in modifying or completely rewriting the existing test
                suite before they can begin implementing the new requirement.
                This constant rework of tests can slow down the development
                process, making the team less responsive to change, which runs
                counter to Agile principles.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong
                  >Difficulty Testing Unclear or Emergent Requirements:</strong
                >
                TDD requires the developer to have a clear enough understanding
                of a requirement to write a specific, failing test for it. If
                the requirements are not just changing but are also vague or
                still emerging, it becomes nearly impossible to write a
                meaningful test upfront. The team might waste effort writing
                tests for functionality that is ultimately incorrect or
                unwanted.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong
                  >Ineffectiveness for Major Architectural Changes:</strong
                >
                TDD is primarily a technique for guiding low-level design (the
                implementation of classes and methods). If a change in
                requirements necessitates a fundamental shift in the high-level
                system architecture, a large portion of the existing unit test
                suite may become irrelevant and need to be discarded. The effort
                invested in creating those tests provides little value in
                guiding the new architectural direction.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Test Suite Maintenance Overhead:</strong> Constant
                changes can lead to a "brittle" test suite, where tests fail due
                to minor implementation changes rather than actual bugs. This
                increases the maintenance burden, as developers spend a
                disproportionate amount of time fixing tests instead of
                delivering value. Over time, this can erode the team's
                confidence in the test suite, diminishing the benefits of TDD.

              Theoretical Deep Dive: Fagan Inspections and The Role of
              Checklists
            </h4>
            <p>
              The modern software inspection process is heavily influenced by
              the work of Michael Fagan at IBM in the 1970s. A Fagan inspection
              is a highly structured, formal process with defined roles
              (Moderator, Author, Reader, Inspector) and stages (Planning,
              Overview, Preparation, Inspection Meeting, Rework, Follow-up). A
              central element of the "Preparation" stage is the use of
              checklists.
            </p>
            <p>
              The checklist serves as a cognitive tool to overcome the
              limitations of human reviewers. Psychology shows that humans are
              poor at spontaneous, unstructured review; we tend to miss things
              and get sidetracked. A checklist provides the necessary structure
              to make the review process rigorous and effective.
            </p>
            <h4>Types of Inspection Checklists:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Generic Checklists:</strong> Contain questions
                applicable to almost any artifact, focusing on clarity,
                consistency, and completeness.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Language-Specific Checklists:</strong> For code
                inspections, these focus on common errors in a particular
                programming language (e.g., checking for memory leaks in C++, or
                correct use of `equals()` vs. `==` in Java).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Domain-Specific Checklists:</strong> Focus on rules and
                constraints from the specific application domain (e.g., a
                checklist for a financial application might include items about
                transaction atomicity and regulatory compliance).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Project-Specific Checklists:</strong> Include checks
                against the project's own coding standards and architectural
                principles.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The power of the checklist comes from its ability to distill past
              experience (i.e., past bugs) into a proactive tool for defect
              prevention.

            <p>
              Preparing inspection checklists is a critical step that
              significantly enhances the effectiveness and efficiency of
              software inspections. Their importance stems from the following
              key contributions:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Ensures a Systematic and Structured Review:</strong> A
                checklist transforms the inspection from an unstructured, ad-hoc
                activity into a formal and repeatable engineering process. It
                provides a clear framework for reviewers, ensuring that all
                participants are systematically examining the artifact against a
                consistent set of criteria. This structure eliminates guesswork
                and leads to more reliable and predictable outcomes.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Provides Focus and Guidance on Common Errors:</strong>
                Checklists are populated with questions targeting known, common
                types of defects specific to the language, technology, or
                application domain (e.g., "Is all user input sanitized?", "Are
                all resources properly closed?"). This focuses the inspectors'
                attention on high-risk areas and helps them find more defects
                than they might through undirected reading. It is particularly
                valuable for guiding less experienced team members.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Guarantees Comprehensive Coverage:</strong> Relying on
                memory alone is prone to error. A checklist acts as a cognitive
                aid, ensuring that no important quality attribute or potential
                error class is overlooked during the review. This leads to a
                more thorough and comprehensive inspection, increasing the
                overall defect detection rate.

                  Improvement:</strong
                >
                The checklist is a living document. As new types of defects are
                discovered in projects, the checklist can be updated. It becomes
                a repository of organizational learning, capturing valuable
                knowledge about common pitfalls and best practices, thereby
                helping to prevent the recurrence of past mistakes.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Static:</strong> Types are checked at compile-time
                    (e.g., Java, C++, C#, Rust).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Dynamic:</strong> Types are checked at run-time
                    (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Ruby).
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Strong vs. Weak Typing:</strong> This refers to *how
                strictly* types are enforced.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Strong:</strong> The language prevents operations on
                    incompatible types (e.g., you can't add an integer to a
                    string in Python without explicit conversion).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Weak:</strong> The language will try to implicitly
                    convert (coerce) types to make an operation work (e.g., in
                    JavaScript, `5 + "3"` results in the string `"53"`).
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The question refers to "lower-level, weakly typed languages." A
              classic example is **C**. C is statically typed, but it is very
              weakly typed because it allows the programmer to easily override
              the type system using pointers and casts. This places a huge
              burden on the developer to ensure type safety manually.

            <p>
              Software inspections are particularly appropriate and effective
              for lower-level, weakly typed languages (such as C or C++) because
              the inspection process serves as a critical manual safeguard
              against entire classes of severe errors that the compilers for
              these languages are designed to permit.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Compensating for Compiler Permissiveness:</strong>
                Compilers for strongly typed, memory-safe languages (like Java
                or Rust) act as a first line of defense, statically rejecting
                code with type mismatches or potential memory access violations.
                In contrast, compilers for weakly typed languages like C
                prioritize developer control and performance over safety. They
                allow unsafe operations like arbitrary pointer casting, direct
                memory manipulation, and buffer overflows. Software inspections
                provide the necessary manual, systematic check to find these
                defects that the compiler, by design, does not catch.

              <li>
                <strong>Targeting Language-Specific Error Classes:</strong>
                Lower-level languages give developers direct control over system
                resources like memory, which is a major source of critical and
                hard-to-diagnose bugs. Inspections are highly effective at
                finding common errors in these languages that are often
                difficult to reproduce with dynamic testing. An experienced
                human inspector, guided by a checklist, can spot patterns that
                lead to:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Memory Leaks:</strong> Forgetting to `free`
                    dynamically allocated memory (`malloc`).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Dangling Pointers:</strong> Using a pointer after
                    the memory it points to has been deallocated.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Buffer Overflows:</strong> Writing past the
                    allocated boundary of an array, a common security
                    vulnerability.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Uninitialized Variables:</strong> Reading from
                    memory that has not been initialized, leading to
                    unpredictable behavior.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              In essence, for these languages, a software inspection is not just
              a quality assurance activity; it is an essential part of the
              development process that provides the safety net the language and
              its tools deliberately omit.

              Theoretical Deep Dive: UML to Object-Oriented Code
            </h4>
            <p>
              This question tests the ability to translate a standard Unified
              Modeling Language (UML) class diagram into concrete code in an
              object-oriented programming (OOP) language. This translation
              requires understanding the core principles of OOP and how they are
              represented visually in UML.
            </p>
            <h4>Core OOP Concepts in the Diagram:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Encapsulation:</strong> The bundling of data
                (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data into a
                single unit (a class). Visibility modifiers (`+`, `#`, `-`) are
                a key part of encapsulation, controlling access to the internal
                state of an object.
                <ul>
                  <li>`+` (public): Part of the object's public interface.</li>
                  <li>
                    `#` (protected): Accessible to the class and its children
                    (subclasses).
                  </li>
                  <li>`-` (private): Accessible only to the class itself.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Inheritance:</strong> The mechanism by which one class
                (`Manager`, the subclass or child) acquires the properties
                (attributes and methods) of another class (`Employee`, the
                superclass or parent). This is represented by the "is-a"
                relationship (a Manager is an Employee). It promotes code reuse
                and creates a hierarchy.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Association:</strong> A relationship between two
                classes. The diagram shows that a `Manager` is associated with a
                `Department`. In this case, it's a structural relationship where
                a `Manager` object contains a reference to a `Department`
                object. This is often implemented using an instance variable
                (attribute).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Polymorphism (Implied):</strong> While not explicitly
                shown, the inheritance hierarchy sets the stage for
                polymorphism. For example, a function could accept an `Employee`
                object, and you could pass it a `Manager` object, as a `Manager`
                is a type of `Employee`. The `work()` method could be overridden
                in the `Manager` class to provide a specific implementation.
              </li>
            </ul>

              Theoretical Deep Dive: Principles of Clean Code
            </h4>
            <p>
              Good code quality is not just about making code that works; it's
              about making code that is readable, understandable, and
              maintainable. This function violates several fundamental
              principles of "Clean Code":
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Meaningful Names:</strong> As described by Robert C.
                Martin, names should be intention-revealing. A name like
                `func_2` or `a` forces the reader to mentally map it to its true
                purpose, increasing cognitive load. Good names make the code
                read like well-written prose.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):</strong> This design
                principle states that most systems work best if they are kept
                simple rather than made complicated. The logic in the function
                is unnecessarily convoluted for the simple task it performs. The
                simplest solution is often the best.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):</strong> While not a direct
                violation here, the verbose logic is related. The intent (`a ==
                "admin"`) is expressed indirectly through an `if` statement and
                a flag variable, rather than directly. Clean code expresses its
                intent as directly as possible.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Dead Code:</strong> Code that is executed but whose
                result is never used (like the assignment `c = a`) is known as
                dead code. It serves no purpose other than to confuse the reader
                and bloat the codebase. It should always be removed.
              </li>

            <h4 class="box-title">Model Answer</h4>
            <p>
              The provided Python function suffers from several significant code
              quality issues that impact its readability, maintainability, and
              conciseness. The primary problems are:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Poor and Non-Descriptive Naming:</strong> The names used
                (`func_2`, `a`, `b`, `c`) are meaningless. They violate the
                principle of writing self-documenting code. A maintainer has no
                idea what the function's purpose is, what type of input `a` is
                expected to be, or what `b` and `c` represent without analyzing
                the logic. A better function name would be `is_admin` or
                `check_user_role`, and a better parameter name would be
                `username` or `role`.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Redundant and Unnecessary Variables:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The variable `c` is a prime example of dead code. It is
                    assigned the value of `a` but is never used again, serving
                    no purpose and adding clutter.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The variable `b` is also redundant. It is used as a "flag"
                    variable, initialized to `False` and then conditionally set
                    to `True`. The entire `if` statement and the variable `b`
                    can be replaced by directly returning the result of the
                    boolean comparison.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Verbose and Unnecessarily Complex Logic:</strong> The
                logic is far more complicated than it needs to be. The pattern
                of initializing a boolean, conditionally changing it inside an
                `if` block, and then returning it is an anti-pattern. The core
                purpose of the function is to evaluate the boolean expression `a
                == "admin"`. This expression itself evaluates to either `True`
                or `False`, so its result can be returned directly, making the
                function a single, clear line of code.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong
                  >Lack of Professional Conventions (Type Hints and
                  Docstrings):</strong
                >
                The function lacks type hints, so it's not clear what type of
                data is expected for the parameter `a` (is it a string, an
                object?). It also lacks a docstring, which would explain its
                purpose, parameters, and return value. These omissions make the
                function difficult to use correctly in a larger system and
                harder for tools like static analyzers to validate.
