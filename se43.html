            <h2>Section 2: The Waterfall Model</h2>
            <ol class="question-list">
                <li><p><strong>11.</strong> Describe the core concept of the Waterfall model.</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('p2_ans11')">Show Answer</button><div id="p2_ans11" class="answer">It is a sequential process where development flows steadily downwards through distinct phases (Requirements, Design, Implementation, etc.). Each phase must be fully completed and signed off before the next one begins.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>12.</strong> List the five main phases of the Waterfall model as shown in the detailed diagram.</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('p2_ans12')">Show Answer</button><div id="p2_ans12" class="answer">1. Requirements analysis and definition. 2. System and software design. 3. Implementation and unit testing. 4. Integration and system testing. 5. Operation and maintenance.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>13.</strong> What is the main argument for using the Waterfall model regarding bug detection?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('p2_ans13')">Show Answer</button><div id="p2_ans13" class="answer">It is more economical if bugs are found earlier in the lifecycle (e.g., during the requirements or design phase), as the cost to fix them increases exponentially in later phases.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>14.</strong> What is a major advantage of the Waterfall model concerning project visibility?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('p2_ans14')">Show Answer</button><div id="p2_ans14" class="answer">Documents are produced at the end of each stage (e.g., requirements specification, design document), which improves the visibility and traceability of the project for management.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>15.</strong> What is the primary criticism of the Waterfall model?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('p2_ans15')">Show Answer</button><div id="p2_ans15" class="answer">It is very difficult and costly to accommodate changing customer requirements because it requires going back to earlier phases and re-doing significant work.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>16.</strong> Why does the Waterfall model struggle with real-world projects?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('p2_ans16')">Show Answer</button><div id="p2_ans16" class="answer">Because it assumes that requirements can be fully known and frozen at the beginning, which is rarely possible. It also assumes that each phase can be perfected before moving to the next.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>17.</strong> For what types of organizations is the Waterfall model still widely used?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('p2_ans17')">Show Answer</button><div id="p2_ans17" class="answer">Large organizations like the US Department of Defense and NASA, especially for large, critical systems where upfront planning and documentation are mandatory.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>18.</strong> When is the Waterfall model considered most applicable?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('p2_ans18')">Show Answer</button><div id="p2_ans18" class="answer">When requirements are very well understood and stable, and the problem domain is familiar to the development organization.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>19.</strong> What key management activity is not explicitly covered by the pure Waterfall model?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('p2_ans19')">Show Answer</button><div id="p2_ans19" class="answer">Risk management.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>20.</strong> How does the Waterfall model contribute to "waste of resources"?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('p2_ans20')">Show Answer</button><div id="p2_ans20" class="answer">A working version of the software is not available until late in the cycle. If the final product does not meet user needs, much of the effort spent in the preceding phases is wasted.</div></li>

            <h2>Section 3: Iterative & Incremental Development</h2>
            <ol class="question-list">
                <li><p><strong>21.</strong> What is the core idea of Incremental Development?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('p2_ans21')">Show Answer</button><div id="p2_ans21" class="answer">To develop an initial implementation, expose it to user comment, and then evolve it through several versions (increments) until an adequate system is developed.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>22.</strong> How does the handling of requirements differ between Waterfall and Incremental models?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('p2_ans22')">Show Answer</button><div id="p2_ans22" class="answer">In Waterfall, requirements are specified upfront. In Incremental models, the specification is developed in conjunction with the software, evolving with each iteration.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>23.</strong> What are three advantages of incremental development over the waterfall model?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('p2_ans23')">Show Answer</button><div id="p2_ans23" class="answer">1. Reduced cost to accommodate changing requirements. 2. Easier to get customer feedback on working software. 3. More rapid delivery of useful functionality.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>24.</strong> How does incremental development provide value to the customer earlier?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('p2_ans24')">Show Answer</button><div id="p2_ans24" class="answer">The first increment typically satisfies the most critical requirements, allowing customers to use the software and gain value immediately rather than waiting for the entire system to be finished.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>25.</strong> What is a major management disadvantage of incremental development?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('p2_ans25')">Show Answer</button><div id="p2_ans25" class="answer">The process is not as visible as in the Waterfall model. Without the regular, formal documents produced at each phase, it can be harder for managers to measure progress.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>26.</strong> What tends to happen to the system structure in incremental development if not managed carefully?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('p2_ans26')">Show Answer</button><div id="p2_ans26" class="answer">The system structure tends to degrade as new increments are added. Regular change can corrupt the structure unless time and money are spent on refactoring to improve it.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>27.</strong> Why can getting useful customer feedback be difficult in iterative development for a replacement system?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('p2_ans27')">Show Answer</button><div id="p2_ans27" class="answer">Users of the old system often want all of its functionality from day one and are unwilling to experiment with an incomplete new system, making it hard to provide feedback on early increments.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>28.</strong> How does incremental development conflict with traditional procurement models?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('p2_ans28')">Show Answer</button><div id="p2_ans28" class="answer">Many organizations' contracts require a complete system specification upfront. In an incremental approach, a complete specification doesn't exist until the final increment is defined, requiring a new form of contract.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>29.</strong> Name three types of iterative development models mentioned in the lecture.</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('p2_ans29')">Show Answer</button><div id="p2_ans29" class="answer">Any three of: Incremental Development, Spiral model, Agile software development, Extreme Programming (XP), Test-Driven Development (TDD).</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>30.</strong> What does it mean for specification, development, and validation to be "interleaved"?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('p2_ans30')">Show Answer</button><div id="p2_ans30" class="answer">It means these activities are not done in separate, long phases. Instead, a small amount of specification is done, followed by development and validation for that piece, and this cycle repeats.</div></li>

                <li><p><strong>38.</strong> Does the Spiral model have fixed phases?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('p2_ans38')">Show Answer</button><div id="p2_ans38" class="answer">No, it does not have fixed phases like the waterfall model. The loops in the spiral are chosen depending on what is required at that stage of the project.</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>39.</strong> How is the process represented visually in the Spiral model?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('p2_ans39')">Show Answer</button><div id="p2_ans39" class="answer">As a spiral rather than a sequence of activities with backtracking.

                <li><p><strong>39.</strong> List three situations that might require an urgent change request.</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('p7_ans39')">Show Answer</button><div id="p7_ans39" class="answer">1. A serious system fault has to be repaired. 2. A change to the system's environment (e.g., an OS upgrade) has unexpected effects. 3. A business change requires a very rapid response (e.g., a competitor's release).</div></li>
                <li><p><strong>40.</strong> How does the process for an urgent change (emergency repair) differ from the standard process?</p><button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer('p7_ans40')">Show Answer</button><div id="p7_ans40" class="answer">It may have to be implemented without going through all the stages of the software engineering process. The process is often shortened to: Analyze source code -> Modify source code -> Deliver modified system.</div></li>
